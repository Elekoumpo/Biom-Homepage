# Biom-Homepage
This repo contains a Home Page for Biom and it is made for interview purposes and should showcase frontend skills.

Initially, I can say the page will be made using HTML, CSS(Tailwind) and React.js.

I've chosen Biom Homepage Design (you said it's your favorite :D). I also really liked the design, it really good for showcasing a lot of things. 
I approached the project in a way to write a page through components using React. Also, I used Tailwind since I initially saw that it might take a lot of CSS and keeping it in one big file or a lot of smaller ones would be
a bit complicated. Also, I like Tailwind more. I've completed the page, but there were some details that could've been done differently/better (aligning font and button requirements with Design file). I focused primarily on completing the whole page and since I had a week to finish everything that was my main goal.

Estimated time that took me to finish this amount of work was around 4-5 days. (I worked from Tuesday after the work (5pm) and finished the rest on the weekend.
Main issues I faced was with adapting all of my fonts and styles to the one in design file. I really couldn't 100% copy the style that was present there in terms of font and general looks.
Other than that everything was pretty OK.

In the mail, I've left all of the commands I've run to get this code running:

These are the commands I've used in order to set up my page locally.
npm install -g npm@10.3.0
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
npm react-multi-carousel
nom install react-responsive-carousel
npm install embla-carousel
npm install react-elastic-carousel

Here are also some of the notes:

1. For some reason the font in some of the paragraphs as well as in the button couldn't be consistent with Design File.
Even though I've used Tailwind and defined the font (Brandon Grotesque and Chronicle Display) it seems like you the font is not similar to yours.
2. I've changed the color of the 'meetbiom' just to showcase the animation a bit better (colors were to similar in initial design)
3. Buttons in Sections 4 and 8/9 are not really 100% consistent to the design.
4. Carousel in the Section 8 is React-Carousel and it doesn't provide some of the functionalities that could be nice to see.
React-Multi-Carousel on the other hand could provide for example continuous movement.
5. I didn't really spend too much time on optimising images. While I was working, they seemed to be decent quality and I thought they
were pretty decent for the demo purposes.
